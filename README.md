# PURPOSE

    - Using C and systems programming tools (fork, pipe, signals), I created a testing library that verifies if a function/method works in accordance with the specifications. Their functionality is simple - they verify that, given a known test input, the returned value matches the expected test output.

# HOW TO RUN

    - To run with the sample main, type 'make' in the command line to get an executable and run './A1SampleMain'
